 *  NOTE about 'width' codes. Usually the 'width' is the number of
 *  bytes that are accessed at the same time while the next value
 *  is the number of chips. Bytes per chips can be found by dividing
 *  'width' with 'chips'. The code 9 for width is special to handle
 *  how the cp7000 addresses the AMD single chip when not mapped as
